# User API - README

This repository contains the implementation of a User API, providing endpoints for managing user-related operations in an application. The User API allows you to create, read, update, and delete user profiles, as well as perform authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **Create User**: Create new user profiles by submitting relevant information such as name, email, and password.

- **Read User Data**: Retrieve user data by querying specific user profiles based on unique identifiers or fetch a list of users.

- **Update User Data**: Update user information, including profile details, passwords, and settings.

- **Delete User**: Remove user profiles from the application or database.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access protected resources.

- **Search and Filtering**: Utilize search and filtering functionalities to find users based on criteria like name or role.

- **Pagination**: Handle large sets of user data with pagination to present the information in manageable sections.

- **Validation and Error Handling**: Validate input data and provide informative error messages for failed requests or incorrect inputs.

- **Security**: Ensure the security of sensitive user data by encrypting passwords and transmitting data securely over HTTPS.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and configure the necessary environment variables. Sample variables include `MONGO_URL`, `MONGO_DB`, `MONGO_COLLECTION`, `BASEPATH`, and `PORT`.

3. **Dependencies**: Run `go get` to install the required Go packages. Install the `godotenv` package using `go get github.com/joho/godotenv` if not already installed.

4. **Running the API**: Execute the `main.go` file to start the API server.

5. **Endpoints**: The API provides endpoints for various user operations. Refer to the [API documentation](api_documentation.md) for details on endpoint URLs and request/response formats.

#User API - README
This repository contains the implementation of a User API, which provides endpoints for managing user-related operations in an application. The User API allows you to create, read, update, and delete user profiles, as well as perform authentication and authorization.

Features
Create User: Create new user profiles by submitting relevant information such as name, email, and password.

Read User Data: Retrieve user data by querying specific user profiles based on unique identifiers or fetch a list of users.

Update User Data: Update user information, including profile details, passwords, and settings.

Delete User: Remove user profiles from the application or database.

Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access protected resources.

Search and Filtering: Utilize search and filtering functionalities to find users based on criteria like name or role.

Pagination: Handle large sets of user data with pagination to present the information in manageable sections.

Validation and Error Handling: Validate input data and provide informative error messages for failed requests or incorrect inputs.

Security: Ensure the security of sensitive user data by encrypting passwords and transmitting data securely over HTTPS.

Getting Started
Installation: Clone this repository to your local environment.

Environment Setup: Create a .env file at the root of the project and configure the necessary environment variables. Sample variables include MONGO_URL, MONGO_DB, MONGO_COLLECTION, BASEPATH, and PORT.
